__Anagrams with Fiends__: A webapp for playing the game Anagrams.
Hosted at http://serene-dawn-1769.herokuapp.com/.

Anagrams is a fast-paced, challenging word game for one or two fiends! To play, create an account and log on to the app at the URL above, then either start a single-player game or challenge another player in the lobby to a duel. Game rules can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams_(game).

How to play:
* During the game, you can flip tiles by clicking the relevant button or by hitting Enter when the word entry box is empty. In a multiplayer game, both players must request a flip in order for a new tile to be flipped.
* To build a word out of the tiles in the pool, simply type it into the word entry box and hit enter; words must be at least three letters long. 
* To upgrade one of your own words, or steal one from an opponent's stash, type the upgraded word into the word entry box, then click on the word you want to upgrade. 

##CHANGELOG
* v1.0: Lobby, multi-player, leaderboard support added.
* v0.1: Single-player support added.
